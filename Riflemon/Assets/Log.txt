ToDo:

Animator, transition from left to right movement. Determine direction towards where the velocity is the biggest
The animations are a bit too slow atm, takes too long for them to initiate


skip menu when first time playing the game and go straight to the intro
save the progression of the game in a way



Story:

like in the real game, you can choose your pokemon from the 3 starter ones. Then when you have selected it, it gets shot and the mc falls mainly in love with the gun.
